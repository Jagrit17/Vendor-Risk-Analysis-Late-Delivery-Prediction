Vendor Risk Analysis & Late Delivery Prediction ðŸš€ 
Machine learning-based vendor risk assessment and late delivery prediction using classification models and anomaly detection.

Overview
This project leverages machine learning models to analyze vendor risk in a supply chain and predict late delivery risks. It uses classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) and anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) to identify high-risk vendors and generate actionable insights.  

Features
âœ… Predict late delivery risk using multiple machine learning models  
âœ… Analyze key risk factors contributing to delivery delays  
âœ… Detect anomalous vendors using Isolation Forest  
âœ… Generate vendor risk rankings 
âœ… Export risk analysis results to CSV for decision-making

Dataset 
This project utilizes the following datasets:  
- DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv â€“ Contains supply chain order data  
- DescriptionDataCoSupplyChain.csv â€“ Provides column descriptions  
- TokenizedAccessLogs.csv â€“ Logs access details for additional insights
